"description": "<p>We're trying something new this time around and putting on a fun and friendly competition over pizza and tasty beverages. There's no requirement to compete if you'd like to just hang out and watch instead.</p> <p>What is Code in the Dark?</p> <p>Code in the Dark (<a href="http://codeinthedark.com/" class="linkified">http://codeinthedark.com/</a>) is a front-end (HTML, CSS) competition, originating from Tictail (<a href="https://tictail.com/" class="linkified">https://tictail.com/</a>), where each contestant competes to implement a website design given only a screenshot. The catch is that no previews of the results are allowed during the implementation, and no measuring tools can be used. The winner is decided by the audience.</p> <p>During the competition, the contestants have to use the custom editor for Code in the Dark, which you can try out here: <a href="http://codeinthedark.com/editor" class="linkified">http://codeinthedark.com/editor</a></p> <p>THE RULES</p> <p>0. Take it easy. This is just for fun!<br/>1. You will need to bring your own laptop for this! If you don't have one and want to compete, reach out as soon as possible so we can figure something out.<br/>2. Each contestant receives a bundle of the editor, which includes a screenshot of the page they should implement with HTML/CSS and any additional assets they might need.<br/>3. No iframes, frameworks, snippets or other assets outside of the ones listed in the instructions are allowed. The site should be built from scratch during the competition.<br/>4. The contestant should have the editor in full screen mode, and is never allowed to exit out of it or use any measurement tools.<br/>5. Previews of the results are strictly forbidden until the time is over.<br/>6. Once the 15 minute timer runs out each contestant presents their result to the audience, who then vote on their favorite to decide the winner.</p> <p>WINNERS AND PRIZES</p> <p>- Bragging rights<br/>- 3 winners will receive a year of CodePen PRO<br/>- All attendees will be entered into a raffle to win 1 of 2 licenses of Sketch<br/>- If you or anyone you know would like to submit branded swag and prizes for this event, please reach out.</p> <p>SPONSORS</p> <p>Venue and food: Race Roster<br/>Prizes: CodePen, Sketch</p> ",
